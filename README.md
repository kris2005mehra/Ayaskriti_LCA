**"An AI-Driven Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Tool for Advancing Circularity and Sustainability in Metallurgy and Mining"**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Ayaskriti is an **AI-powered, real-time LCA platform** designed for the metallurgy and mining sectors. It allows industries to evaluate **environmental impact** and **circularity** with minimal data input, filling gaps using AI/ML models. Users can compare linear (raw) and circular (recycled) pathways and generate actionable sustainability insights across the full value chain—from extraction to reuse.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

* Industries struggle with **incomplete or inconsistent data** when performing Life Cycle Assessments (LCA).
* Existing LCA tools are **complex, slow, and not suited for real-time industrial decision-making**.
* Companies find it **difficult to compare linear vs circular production pathways**.
* Decision-making is **delayed due to high data requirements and limited visualization tools**.
